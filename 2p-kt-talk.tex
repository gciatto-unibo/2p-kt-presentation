\section{Historical Perspective}

\subsection{Prolog History}

\subsection{\tuprolog{} History}

\section{Motivation}

\begin{frame}{Why \twopkt{}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item builging an open an extensible ecosystem\ldots
        \item \ldots supporting multiple logics, inference procedures, and resolution strategies (on the long run)
        \item making each aspect of LP individually usable \emph{per se}
        \item reaching widest possible platform support 
        \item blending LP with OOP and FP
        \item bridging symbolic and sub-symbolic AI
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Which features of LP}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item knowledge representation: term, clauses, and knowledge bases
        \item unification, based on \cite{MartelliMontanari1982} but possibly customisable
        \item clauses indexing and in-memory storage facilities
        \item Prolog-like syntax parsing \& formatting
        \item serialization/deserialization of terms, clauses, and theories
        \item generic resolution API, possibly customisable via pluggable features
        \item SLDFNF (Prolog-like) resolution streategy
        \item other resolution strategies
        \item common UI facilities
        \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Kotlin}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item multi platform support
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

        \item modules explanations
        \item dependencies among modules
