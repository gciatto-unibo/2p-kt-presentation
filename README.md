# 2P-Kt: A Kotlin Multi-Platform ecosystem for symbolic AI 

by [Giovanni Ciatto](mailto:giovanni.ciatto@unibo.it) and [Lorenzo Rizzato](mailto:lorenzo.rizzato@studio.unibo.it)

## Abstract

Computational logic and _logic programming_ (LP) play a central role in AI.
While their impact on _symbolic_ AI is well established, emergent AI techniques leverage on logic to make data-driven AI more predictable or understandable.
Thus, the need for solid, interoperable, general-purpose _logic-based technologies_ (LBT) is more compelling than ever.

Most LBT are either built on top or as extensions of the Prolog language.
Even when this is not the case, _monolithic_ solutions are built around different inference procedures, unification mechanisms, or knowledge representation techniques.
However, LBT should be neither constructed as Prolog-centred monoliths nor tailored to a specific semantics or language.
To maximise their AI-related impact, LBT should welcome the manifold contributions coming from the LP playground, supporting the general-purposes exploitation of as many mechanisms as possible.

Accordingly, we present 2P-Kt, a reboot of the tuProlog project offering a general, extensible, and interoperable _ecosystem_ for LP and symbolic AI.
